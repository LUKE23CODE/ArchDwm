# Glitch cat

## Our flag printing service has started glitching!

```bash
nc saturn.picoctf.net 65353
```

### Output

```bash
'picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_' + chr(0x39) + chr(0x63) + chr(0x34) + chr(0x32) + chr(0x61) + chr(0x34) + chr(0x35) + chr(0x64) + '}'
```

Then I opened a python idle in terminal to get the rest of the flag...

picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_9c42a45d}
