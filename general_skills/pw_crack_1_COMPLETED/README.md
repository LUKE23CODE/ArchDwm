## Exercise

Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag in the same directory too.

### Input

I ran this command after I looked at the source code with ```nvim level1.py```

```bash
python level1.py
```

### Output

```bash
Please enter correct password for flag: 8713
Welcome back... your flag, user:
picoCTF{545h_r1ng1ng_1b2fd683}
```

I've get the passwd in the source code...
